# Mapping of microRNA - mediated Gene Regulatory Networks across different tissues  in Schizophrenia

- Generated a comprehensive network map of miRNA-gene interactions in Schizophrenia using the TargetScan prediction framework
- Identified several active slices of this network across multiple tissues using contextual expression-based parameters
- Integrating the tissue-specific network maps, identified genes with maximum convergence across tissues as well as existing FDA-approved drugs targeting them for drug-repositioning

## Methodology

1. Universal miRNA-Gene Regulatory Network
2. Adding Biological Context to the network
3. Comparision of Network across multiple tissues

## Tissues

- iPSCs
- PBMCs
- BA22
- BA10
- BA46
